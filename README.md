## Purpose of our project
Our project is going to make a chatbot web application with multiple functions to our users including:
1) login and sign up with username and password
2) chat with chatbot interactively
3) review and search the chat log

## The architecture our web application
Our web application mainly consists of a front-end and a back-end.

### Front-end
The front-end is primarily responsible for rendering the user interface. It is constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Ajax for asynchronous communication with the back-end. Functions such as user login, sign up, interaction with the chatbot, and viewing and searching chat logs are all executed here.

### Back-end
The back-end uses the Flask framework to handle requests sent from the front-end, such as user login, registration, and processing user interactions with the chatbot. For the chatbot implementation, we are using the OpenAI's GPT model. 

### Database
We use MongoDB as our database to store user account information and chat logs.
